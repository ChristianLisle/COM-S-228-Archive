# COM-S-228-Archive
This is an archive of my assignments from the course Computer Science 228 (Data structures) at Iowa State University in the spring of 2020. **More information about this class will be available on my website after I have completed the course.**

All assignments are listed in the index, sorted accordingly.
The PDF (assignment specifications/instructions) given to me for each assignment, along with the JUnit tests I was given are contained in each directory accordingly.
